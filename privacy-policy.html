  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025-10-20</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This is a demo privacy policy page for development and testing of the SMM Manager app. This page explains what personal data (if any) the application collects and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data collected</h2>
  <p>For testing purposes, this app does not collect or store personal data on the public demo. When deployed, the application may store user-supplied account tokens to integrate with social platforms. Tokens are kept securely and are not shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>Use of data</h2>
  <p>Data is used only to publish content to connected social accounts and to show publishing status. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, contact: <a href="mailto:hojiakbar@example.com">hojiakbar@example.com</a></p>

  <p style="color:#666; font-size:0.9em; margin-top:30px;">This page is a minimal demo privacy policy suitable for development/testing. Replace it with a full policy before production use.</p>
